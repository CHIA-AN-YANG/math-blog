# Project Summary
The project is a personal blog website built using the VitePress framework, designed to facilitate the sharing of mathematical notes and code examples. It supports LaTeX for rendering complex mathematical expressions and features syntax highlighting for code blocks. The blog adopts a two-column layout with the main content in the center and a right sidebar that lists articles and allows users to filter content by tags. The primary goal is to provide a clean, user-friendly platform for sharing and discussing mathematical concepts.

# Project Module Description
- **VitePress Configuration**: Configures the site settings, including LaTeX support and sidebar navigation.
- **Theme Customization**: Manages the visual appearance of the blog and includes the TagList component for filtering articles by tags.
- **Content Management**: Facilitates the creation and organization of blog posts, including the homepage and individual articles.
