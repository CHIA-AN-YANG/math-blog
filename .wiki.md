# Project Summary
The project is a personal blog website built using the VitePress framework, aimed at sharing mathematical notes and code examples. It supports LaTeX for rendering complex mathematical expressions and features syntax highlighting for code blocks. The blog adopts a two-column layout with the main content in the center and a right sidebar for article listings and tag filtering. Recently, an engaging text animation effect has been added to the homepage's title, enhancing the user experience and visual appeal.
