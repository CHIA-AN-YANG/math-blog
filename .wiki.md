# Project Summary
The project is a personal blog website built using the VitePress framework. It is designed to support LaTeX for mathematical notes and includes code blocks with syntax highlighting. The blog features a two-column layout where the main content is displayed in the center, and a right sidebar lists all articles and allows filtering by tags. The goal is to provide a clean and functional platform for users to write and share mathematical content and code examples.

# Project Module Description
- **VitePress Configuration**: Manages the overall site settings, including LaTeX support and sidebar navigation.
- **Theme Customization**: Customizes the appearance and layout of the blog, integrating the TagList component for article filtering.
- **Content Management**: Handles blog posts, including the homepage and individual articles, showcasing math notes and code examples.

# Technology Stack
- **VitePress**: A static site generator powered by Vue.js, optimized for documentation.
- **Markdown**: Used for writing blog posts and documentation.
- **MathJax**: Integrated for rendering LaTeX mathematics.
- **Vue.js**: Framework used for building the interactive components of the blog.

# Usage
To set up and run the blog, follow these steps:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install markdown-it-mathjax3
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run docs:dev
   ```

This will launch the blog locally where you can view and test the features, including LaTeX support for math notes and code syntax highlighting.
