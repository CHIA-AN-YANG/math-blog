# Introduction
<PostInfo/>

Welcome to my blog! This platform is my place to write and share mathematical notes.
Since I am studying LLM, I just want to have a clean space to store my learning path with minimal functionalities, including latex feature, which is crucial to taking notes in math.

That's how this blog is born. It is written with the help of MetaGPT AI agentteam. MetaGPT is truely fun to work with! So I also put the introduction to MetaGPT in the navbar. Nevertheless,
I won't be able to make this blog in one day with Vue3 without their help!

## Features

1. **LaTeX Support**
   Write mathematical equations like this: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

2. **Code Blocks**
   ```python
   def fibonacci(n):
       if n <= 1:
           return n
       return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
   ```

3. **Tag Organization**
   Browse posts by tags using the sidebar (to be implemented)
